MANIC SPACE MAN
===============

Javascript platformer clone of Manic Miner, winner of the 8WeekGame competition 2010.  
Entrants could create any game they liked, using any technology they liked, provided 
it was all coded from scratch and within the 8 week time limit!

Apologies to anyone whom I've ripped off for use of their grapics/ sounds- all assets 
were sourced from frantic google searches, mostly on the evening of the last day!
